#### 7) Create a README file to answer the following question-


#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
ans:
var -> Can be re-declared and updated.
let -> Can be updated, but not re-declared in the same scope.
const -> Neither re-declared nor updated (value is constant).

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 
ans:
map() -> Creates a new array by applying a function to each element.Does not change the original array.Always returns the same length as the original array.

forEach() -> Loops through each element, executes a function.Does not return anything (returns undefined).Used for side effects (e.g., printing, updating external variables).

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
Ans: Arrow functions are a shorter way to write functions in JavaScript (introduced in ES6).

#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
Ans: Destructuring allows you to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables in a clean, short way.
#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
Ans: Template Literals (ES6) -> Template literals are a modern way of working with strings in JavaScript. Instead of using quotes (' ' or " "), they use backticks (`).

Difference from String Concatenation ->
With string concatenation, you must manually join strings and variables using +, which becomes messy and harder to read.
With template literals, you can insert variables directly with ${ }, making the syntax much cleaner.
Template literals also support multi-line strings naturally, while concatenation requires special escape characters (\n).
## ⚙️ Functionalities
